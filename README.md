# Example Project

This is an opinionated project layout, how I think you should layout your projects. View the chapters for each part below.

## Documentation

Please read the documentation on how to best use this template and installation. You can find it on the docs branch [here](https://github.com/rocult/script-template/tree/docs).

## Side Note

I realise how ugly all the configuration files can look, sorry for that... Nothing we can do really :( I minimised the issue by moving all the configuration into [pesde.toml](./pesde.toml) but it still needs to be built via `pesde run config`.
